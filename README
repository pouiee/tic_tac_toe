Hello!

I created this tic tac toe simulator for a Python Udemy course.
Two players, playing locally, will be able to enter columns and rows to place Xs and Os.

Columns and rows have been labeled 1, 2, 3 with lowest values on bottom left and highest on top right.
This naming convention was selected to make the game accessible to all players.

I am interested in updating the layout to facilitate Machine Learning algorithm implementations.
If anyone else is interested in this, please reach out and I can begin updating the code

Thank you for reading and visiting my page and be sure to look at my other projects if you like this one!
