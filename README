Hello!

I created this tic tac toe simulator using no object oriented programming, instead focusing on my functional 
programming skills to create this game.

Two players, playing locally, will be able to enter columns and rows to place Xs and Os.
Alternatively, a game can be set up with two different AI players with new functions provided.

Columns and rows have been labeled 1, 2, 3 with lowest values on bottom left and highest on top right.
This naming convention was selected to make the game accessible to all players.

Thank you for reading and visiting my page and be sure to look at my other projects if you like this one!
